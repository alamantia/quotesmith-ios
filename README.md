quotesmith-ios


This is a small game that involves dragging around tiles which contain words, the app computes the euclidan distance between 
the tiles and checks to see if the user has unscrambled a quote.

quotes were sourced from a wikiquote/wikimarkup parser scraper written in python using beatuifulsoup
