quotesmith-ios


This is a small game that involves dragging around tiles which contain the words of a quote, the app computes the euclidan distance between 
the tiles and checks to see if the user has unscrambled a quote 

there is also an simple algorithm to detect word adjaceny to visually indicate if two adjacent words are part of the quote.

quotes were sourced from a wikiquote/wikimarkup parser scraper written in python using beatuifulsoup
