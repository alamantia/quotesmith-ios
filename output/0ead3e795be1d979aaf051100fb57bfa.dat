{"quote": "Number three is always fortunate", "page_title": "Superstition", "page_bio": "Superstition is a credulous belief or notion, not based on reason, knowledge, or experience. The word is often used pejoratively to refer to folk beliefs deemed irrational. This leads to some superstitions being called \"old wives tales\". It is also commonly applied to beliefs and practices surrounding luck, prophecy and spiritual beings, particularly irrational belief that future events can be influenced or foretold by specific unrelated prior events.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Superstition"}
