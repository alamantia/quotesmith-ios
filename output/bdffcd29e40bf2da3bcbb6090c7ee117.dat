{"quote": "A chaque pied son soulier", "page_title": "Shoemaking", "page_bio": "Shoemaking is a traditional handicraft profession, which has now been largely superseded by industrial manufacture of footwear. Shoemakers or cordwainers (cobblers being, historically, those that repair shoes) may produce a range of footwear items, including shoes, boots, sandals, clogs and moccasins. Such items are generally made of leather, wood, rubber, plastic, jute or other plant material, and often consist of multiple parts for better durability of the sole, stitched to a leather upper.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoemaking"}
