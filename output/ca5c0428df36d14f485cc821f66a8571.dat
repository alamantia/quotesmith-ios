{"quote": "Sam Sam pick oop tha musket", "page_title": "Marriott Edgar", "page_bio": "Marriott Edgar (October 5, 1880 \u2013 May 5, 1951) was a British writer and comedian, best remembered for his comic monologues about Lancashire working-class characters and about figures from English history.  These were popularized in the music halls and on records by Stanley Holloway, who also wrote his own monologues about some of the same characters.  Works by Edgar and Holloway are therefore often misattributed to each other.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marriott Edgar"}
