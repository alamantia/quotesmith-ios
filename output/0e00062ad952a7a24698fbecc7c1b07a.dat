His writing career began in 1942 when he compiled his experiences in World War II and had them published in the Post. In 2008 The Times placed Dahl 16th on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\". His short stories are known for their unexpected endings, and his childrens books for their unsentimental, often very dark humour. Two of his most famous works are James and the Giant Peach and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald Dahl"}
