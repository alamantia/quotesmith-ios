He is popularly known as \"the laughing philosopher\" for advocating a cheerful outlook, and for his rhetorical use of irony and ridicule. A pupil of Leucippus, he was an influential pre-Socratic philosophy who formulated an atomic theory of the universe. Of his voluminous writings, only a few fragments of his ethical theory remain, with descriptions by other writers of his atomic theory. ", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democritus"}
