{"quote": "Pereant qui ante nos nostra dixerent", "page_title": "Plagiarism", "page_bio": "Plagiarism is the close imitation of another authors language, thoughts, ideas, or expressions, and the representation of them as ones own original work. The notion remains problematic with nebulous boundaries, but the modern concept of plagiarism as immoral and originality as an ideal emerged in Europe only in the 18th century, particularly with the Romantic movement, while in the previous centuries authors and artists were encouraged to copy the masters as closely as possible and avoid unnecessary invention.  The 18th century new morals have been institutionalized and enforced prominently in the sectors of academia and journalism, where plagiarism is now considered academic dishonesty and a breach of journalistic ethics, subject to sanctions like expulsion and other severe career damage.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plagiarism"}
