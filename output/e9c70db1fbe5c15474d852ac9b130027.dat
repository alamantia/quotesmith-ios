{"quote": "America is the paradise of lawyers", "page_title": "Lawyers", "page_bio": "Lawyers are people who practice law. In most countries, lawyers enter their profession through a period of specialized study. Lawyers are a frequent target of criticism, in part because they are often the public face of unscrupulous parties such as persons being tried for crimes, because they employ a specialized jargon which makes it difficult for persons without a legal education to receive the benefits of the legal system without hiring a lawyer, and because they make up a disproportionate percentage of politicians.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawyer"}
