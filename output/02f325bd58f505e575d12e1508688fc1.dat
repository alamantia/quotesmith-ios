He became one of the most prominent commanders of Nazi Germanys armed forces (Wehrmacht). During World War II he attained the rank of Field Marshal (Generalfeldmarschall) and was held in high esteem by his fellow officers as one of the Wehrmachts best military minds. He was dismissed from service by Adolf Hitler in March 1944, due to his frequent clashes with Hitler over military strategy. In 1949, he was brought on trial in Hamburg for war crimes, which convicted him of \"Neglecting to protect civilian lives\" and for using scorched earth tactics denying vital food supplies to the local population. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison, which was later reduced to 12. After release from British prison in 1953, he became a military advisor for the West German Government. Manstein suffered a stroke and died in Munich on the night of 9 June 1973. He was buried with full military honors. ", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erich von Manstein"}
