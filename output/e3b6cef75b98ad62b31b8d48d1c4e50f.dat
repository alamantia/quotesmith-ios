{"quote": "Thou pigeonegg of discretion", "page_title": "Doves", "page_bio": "Columbidae and pigeons constitute the Birds|bird family Columbidae within the order Columbiformes, which include some 300 species of near passerines, stout-bodied birds with short necks, and have short slender bills. In general terms \"dove\" and \"pigeon\" are used somewhat interchangeably. In ornithological practice, there is a tendency for \"dove\" to be used for smaller species and \"pigeon\" for larger ones, but this is in no way consistently applied, and historically the common names for these birds involve a great deal of variation between the terms \"dove\" and \"pigeon.\" The species commonly referred to just as \"pigeon\" is the Feral Rock Pigeon, common in many cities.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbidae"}
