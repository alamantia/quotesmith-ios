{"quote": "Ex quovis ligno non fit Mercurius", "page_title": "Sculpture", "page_bio": "Sculpture is three-dimensional artwork. Traditionally, such artwork was created by shaping or combining hard materials - typically stone such as marble - or metal, glass, or wood. Softer (\"plastic\") materials can also be used, such as clay, textiles, plastics, polymers and softer metals. Modernly, the term has been extended to works including sound, text and light.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sculpture"}
