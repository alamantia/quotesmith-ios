{"quote": "Has death his fopperies", "page_title": "Foppery", "page_bio": "Fop is a pejorative term describing a foolish man overly concerned with his appearance and clothes in 17th century England. Some of the very many similar alternative terms are: \"coxcomb\", fribble, \"popinjay\" (meaning \"parrot\"), fashion-monger, and \"ninny\". \"Macaroni\" was another term, of the 18th century, more specifically concerned with fashion. A modern-day fop may also be a reference to a foolish person who is overly concerned about his clothing and incapable of engaging in intellectual conversations, activities or thoughts.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fop"}
