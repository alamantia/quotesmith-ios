{"quote": "his dying words MY PENSION", "page_title": "Hudson Hawk", "page_bio": "Hudson Hawk is a 1991 in film that makes heavy use of cartoon-style slapstick, including sound effects, which enhances the movies signature surreal humour. The plot combines material based on conspiracy theories, secret societies, and historic mysteries, as well as outlandish \"clockpunk\" technology \u00e0 la the Our Man Flint movies of the 1960s, which starred James Coburn, who likewise stars in this film.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hudson Hawk"}
