{"quote": "Da locum melioribus", "page_title": "Modesty", "page_bio": "Modesty is often used as synonym of humility and an antonym of boastfulness; a modest person does not draw attention to their own real or supposed accomplishments and desirable attributes. Terms related to \"modesty\" in this sense include \"shyness\", and \"simplicity\". Related usages occur to describe modes of dress and deportment that are not considered ostentatious or alluring, or some object or attribute that is, in fact, not very desirable; a \"modest dwelling\" would describe a hut rather than a palace.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modesty"}
