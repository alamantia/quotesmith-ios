{"quote": "I hate you", "page_title": "River Song", "page_bio": "River Song (Doctor Who) is a fictional character played by Alex Kingston in the British science-fiction series Doctor Who. Within the series narrative, River Song is an experienced companion (Doctor Who) of the Doctor. Because she and the Doctor are both time travelers, their adventures together are largely experienced out of sequence in the chronology of each others lives, resulting in surprising consequences for them and their unusual romantic life together, including the fact that the first time he meets her, is the last time she meets him, as she sacrifices her life to save his. In the 2011 episode A Good Man Goes to War it is revealed that she was born Melody Pond, the daughter of Amy Pond and Rory Williams, and in the following episode, Lets Kill Hitler, it is revealed she spent years of her life as Mels, the childhood friend of her mother \u2014\u00a0and thus was in fact named after herself.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Merging and moving pages"}
