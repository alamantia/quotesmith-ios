He gained international prominence in 1968 by denouncing the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia. After visits in 1971 to China and North Korea, he pursued a program of rapid construction and development combined with mass propaganda. He responded to the tightening of credit in the 1980s with a severe austerity campaign that brought the country to the edge of starvation. Romanians rose up against Ceau\u015fescu in December 1989, and he was overthrown and executed by officials within his government.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nicolae Ceau\u015fescu"}
