The senses and their operation, classification, and theory are overlapping topics studied by a variety of fields, most notably neuroscience, cognitive psychology (or cognitive science), and philosophy of perception. The nervous system has a specific sensory system or organ, dedicated to each sense. Human beings have a multitude of senses, including the five traditional senses of sight, hearing, taste, smell, and touch, and other senses such as balance and the ability to note the passage of time.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sense"}
