He has been played by numerous actors, including Roger Delgado, Peter Pratt, Geoffrey Beevers, Anthony Ainley, Gordon Tipple, Eric Roberts, Derek Jacobi and John Simm. The Doctor thought him dead after his Prime Minister Harold Saxon incarnation, until his resurrection in a sabotaged ritual which left him in a failing body but with the ability to manipulate his life force as electrical energy.
