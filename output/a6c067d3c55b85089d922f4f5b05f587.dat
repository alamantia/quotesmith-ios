{"quote": "Deus Ex Invisible War", "page_title": "The Nameless Mod", "page_bio": "The Nameless Mod is a 2009 in gaming about an internet forum dedicated to the popular computer game Deus Ex with a story of its own, eerily similar to the original game, with conspiracies to unravel and factions to side with.  Most notably however are the two parallel storylines, hence the difference in certain characters attitudes toward Trestkon, the protagonist; namely, Scara B. King and King Kashue, the leaders of the two organizations you can side with, but also their various associates.  The Nameless Mod is a total-conversion modification of Deus Ex; itself free, but requires Deus Ex with the latest patch to play.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Nameless Mod"}
