{"quote": "Brutally masterful allegory", "page_title": "Dogville", "page_bio": "Dogville (2003) is a movie written and directed by Lars von Trier, starring Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany. It is a parable that uses an extremely minimal, stage-like set to tell the story of Grace Mulligan (Kidman), a woman hiding from mobsters, who arrives in the small mountain town of Dogville, Colorado, and is provided refuge in return for physical labor. Her stay there ultimately changes the lives of the local people and the town in many ways.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dogville"}
