{"quote": "Juravi lingua mentem injuratam gero", "page_title": "Oaths", "page_bio": "Oaths or either statements of fact or promises calling upon something or someone that the oath maker considers sacred, usually their god, as a witness to the binding nature of the promise or the truth of the statement of fact. To swear is to take an oath, to make a solemn vow. Those who conscientiously object to making an oath will often make an affirmation instead. The essence of a divine oath is an invocation of divine agency to be a guarantor of the oath takers own honesty and integrity in the matter under question. By implication, this invokes divine displeasure if the oath taker fails in their sworn duties. It therefore implies greater care than usual in the act of the performance of ones duty, such as in testimony to the facts of the matter in a court of law.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oaths"}
