He worked successfully from the regime of Louis XVI, through the French Revolution and then under Napoleon I, Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Louis-Philippe. Known since the turn of the 19th century simply by the name Talleyrand, he remains a figure that polarizes opinion. Some regard him as one of the most versatile, skilled and influential diplomats in European history, and some believe that he was a traitor, betraying in turn, the Ancien R\u00e9gime, the French Revolution, Napoleon, and the Restoration.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles Maurice de Talleyrand-P\u00e9rigord"}
