{"quote": "Tes amis viennent de te fusiller", "page_title": "Les Mis\u00e9rables", "page_bio": "Les Mis\u00e9rables (1862) is a novel by Victor Hugo which many consider to be one of the greatest works of world literature. It tells of the interwoven lives of its characters over several decades of the early 19th Century, focusing to a great extent on the conflicts between the hero Jean Valjean, a fugitive who spent nearly 20 years of his life as prisoner \"24601\" and police inspector Javert who hunts for him. Others who feature prominently are Cosette the orphaned girl who Valjean raises as a daughter, Marius the revolutionary who loves her,  and the villain Thenardier who had horribly exploited Cosette until she was rescued by Valjean.  It was originally published in five volumes, four named after some of the primary characters within it. The primary translation used in creating this collection of quotations was that of Charles E. Wilbour.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les Mis\u00e9rables"}
