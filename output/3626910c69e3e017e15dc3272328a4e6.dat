{"quote": "Rehab is 4 quitters", "page_title": "Cannabis", "page_bio": "Cannabis is a genus of flowering plant believed to be indigenous to Central Asia, China, and the north-west Himalayas. The common name for Cannabis is hemp, although this term is sometimes used to refer only to strains cultivated for \"industrial\" (non-drug) use. Cannabis plants produce a unique family of compounds called cannabinoids, several of which produce mental and/or physiological effects when consumed. The drug usually comes in the form of dried flowers and leaves (marijuana), resin (hashish), or various extracts. The cultivation or possession of Cannabis for drug purposes is outlawed in most countries. In Australia each state has different rules for the amount of marijuana you can possess before facing criminal charges. ", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cannabis"}
