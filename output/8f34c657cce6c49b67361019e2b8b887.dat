The book is composed of a 669-page Text, which sets forth the theory, a 488-page Workbook for Students, which sets the theory in motion, and a 92-page Manual for Teachers, which is a short FAQ answering questions commonly asked by students. The Course, as referred to by its students, was first published in 1976 but was later revised to have neater chapter structure and subtitles and was republished in 1992. There are currently over one and a half million copies of the Course in circulation worldwide, and in over 16 different languages.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A Course in Miracles"}
