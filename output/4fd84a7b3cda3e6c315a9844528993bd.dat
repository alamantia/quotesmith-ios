{"quote": "The Sarah Jane Adventures", "page_title": "Doctor Who", "page_bio": "Doctor Who is a long-running television program produced by the BBC about a mysterious time-travelling adventurer known only as \"The Doctor\", a Time Lord from the planet of Gallifrey, who explores time and space with various companions (primarily human females) in his TARDIS. It is currently the longest-running science-fiction series broadcast on television, spanning twenty-six years on its original run, and 12  actors have headlined the series as the Doctor. As a complete list of quotations from all eras of the show is too large to be contained on one page, this article has been split into subarticles, with quotations organised by which actor was portraying the Doctor at the time the episode was originally broadcast.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doctor Who"}
