{"quote": "Who shot me No one", "page_title": "Dutch Schultz", "page_bio": "Dutch Schultz, whose given name was Arthur Flegenheimer (6 August 1902\u201324 October 1935), was a New York City-area Jewish gangster of the 1920s and 30s. Born in the Bronx, he made his fortune in bootlegging illegal alcohol and the numbers racket in Harlem. Shot while urinating in the bathroom of a bar in New Jersey in 1935, he lived for 24 hours after the bullet tore through his abdominal wall, lung, gall bladder, and liver, before exiting at the small of his back; during the hours before his death, a delirious Schultz gave a several thousand word long \"confession\" which has become the object of much speculation in the years since his death, as nearly seven million dollars of his fortune was never accounted for, and many (including his rivals) believed that the location of the money was hidden in his dying words.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dutch Schultz"}
