The film encompasses three time periods within a millennium: a 16th-century conquistador hunting for a Mayan eternity legend, a modern scientist battling cancer with amazonian compounds, and an ancient shaman in deep space, all of which synchronize in a series of parallels, fittingly chronicled in the scientists dying wifes novel.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Fountain"}
