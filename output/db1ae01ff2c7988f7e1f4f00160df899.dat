{"quote": "Place your bets", "page_title": "Freddy vs. Jason", "page_bio": "Freddy vs. Jason is 2003 in film in which Freddy Krueger has grown weak, as the citizens of fictional Springwood, Ohio have suppressed their fear of him. In order to regain his power, he resurrects Jason Voorhees (from the Friday the 13th (franchise)) and manipulates him into traveling to Springwood to cause panic and fear. However, while Jason succeeds in causing enough fear for Freddy to haunt the town again, he continues to intrude on Freddys territory and steal his potential victims. This ultimately sends the two monsters into a violent conflict.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freddy vs. Jason"}
