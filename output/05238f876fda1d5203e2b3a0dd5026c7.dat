{"quote": "Mad as a March hare", "page_title": "Insanity", "page_bio": "Insanity, craziness, or madness, is a spectrum of behaviors characterized by certain abnormal mental or behavioral patterns. Insanity may manifest in people as violations of societal norms, including becoming a danger to themselves and others, though not all such acts are considered insanity. In modern usage insanity is most commonly encountered as an informal unscientific term denoting mental instability, or in the narrow legal context of the insanity defense.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insanity"}
