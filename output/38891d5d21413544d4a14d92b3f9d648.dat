{"quote": "Order is Heavens first law", "page_title": "An Essay on Man", "page_bio": "An Essay on Man is a poem written by Alexander Pope in 1733\u20131734.  It is a rationalistic effort to use philosophy in order to, as John Milton attempted, justify the ways of God to man. It is concerned with the part evil plays in the world and with the social order God has decreed for man. Because man cannot know Gods purposes, he cannot complain about the existence of evil and must accept that Whatever is, is right. More than any other work, it popularized optimistic philosophy throughout England and the rest of Europe.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/An Essay on Man"}
