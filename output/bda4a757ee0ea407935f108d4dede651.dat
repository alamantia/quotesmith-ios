He is chiefly remembered for his principled refusal to accept King Henry VIII of Englands claim to be the supreme head of the Church of England, a decision which ended his political career and led to his execution as a traitor. In 1935, four hundred years after his death, More was canonized in the Catholic Church and was later declared the patron saint of statesmen, lawyers, and politicians.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas More"}
