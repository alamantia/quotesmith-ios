It is considered Holy city to the three major Abrahamic religions \u2014 Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  Israeli people and Palestinian people both claim Jerusalem as their capital, as Israel maintains its primary governmental institutions there and the State of Palestine ultimately foresees it as its seat of power; however, neither claim is widely recognized internationally.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jerusalem"}
