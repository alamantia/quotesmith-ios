{"quote": "Pessimum genus inimicorum laudantes", "page_title": "Flattery", "page_bio": "Flattery (also called adulation or blandishment) is the act of giving excessive compliments, generally for the purpose of ingratiating oneself with the subject. Historically, flattery has been used as a standard form of discourse when addressing a king or queen. In the Renaissance, it was a common practice among writers to flatter the reigning monarch, as Edmund Spenser flattered Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I in The Faerie Queene, William Shakespeare flattered James I of England|King James I in Macbeth and Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli flattered Lorenzo II di Piero de Medici, ruler of Florence and Duke of Urbino, in The Prince. Most associations with flattery, however, are negative. Negative descriptions of flattery range at least as far back in history as The Bible. In the Divine Comedy, Dante depicts flatterers wading in human excrement, stating that their words were the equivalent of excrement, in the 8th Circle of Hell.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flattery"}
