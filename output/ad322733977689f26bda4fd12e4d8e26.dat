{"quote": "Restless sunflower cease to move", "page_title": "Sunflowers", "page_bio": "Sunflower (Helianthus annuus) are an annual plant native to the Americas that possess a large inflorescence (Flowers|flowering head). The sunflower got its name from its huge, fiery blooms, whose shape and image is often used to depict the sun. The sunflower has a rough, hairy stem, broad, coarsely toothed, rough leaves and circular heads of flowers. The heads consist of 1,000-2,000 individual flowers joined together by a receptacle base. From the Americas, sunflower seeds were brought to Europe in the 16th century, where, along with sunflower oil, they became a widespread cooking ingredient. Sunflower leaves can be used as cattle feed, while the stems contain a fibre which may be used in paper production.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflower"}
