The movie is about the washed-up stars of a fictional 1978\u20131982 TV series called Galaxy Quest and an alien race (the Thermians) who, having no concept of fiction, believe it to be a \"historical document.\" The Thermians have modeled every aspect of their society on the show, including building a fully functional replica of the shows ship, the NSEA Protector. The actors subsequently join the crew of the real Protector, with the Thermians under the impression that the actors really are their characters, to try and stop General Sarris, a villain who threatens to destroy the Thermians.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy Quest"}
