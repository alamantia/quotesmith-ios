On 6 September 1536, he was killed by strangulation and then burned at the stake. Much of Tyndales work eventually found its way to the King James Version of the Bible, published in 1611, which, though the work of 54 independent scholars, is based primarily on Tyndales translations.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William Tyndale"}
