Although listed as a comedy in the first Folio, modern editors have relabelled the play a romance.  There has been a good deal of dispute over when the play was written, with dates ranging from 1594 to 1610 or 1611.  It is sometimes considered to be one of the \"problem plays\" because the first three acts are filled with intense psychological drama, while the last two acts are comedic and supply a happy ending.
