{"quote": "Nervi belli pecunia infinita", "page_title": "War", "page_bio": "War is a conflict involving the organized use of weapons and physical force by states or other large-scale groups. Warring parties usually hold territory, which they can win or lose; and each has a leading person or organization which can surrender, or collapse, thus ending the war. Wars are usually a series of military campaigns between two opposing sides involving a dispute over sovereignty, territory, natural resource, religion, or ideology. A war to liberation an military occupation country is called a \"War of Liberation\"; a war between internal factions within a state is a civil war. Until the end of World War II, participants usually issued formal Declaration of war.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edwin Starr"}
