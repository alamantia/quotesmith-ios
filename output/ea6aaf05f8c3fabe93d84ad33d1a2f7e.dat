The specific legal definition varies by legal jurisdiction. Fraud is a crime, and also a civil law violation. Defrauding people or entities of money or valuables is a common purpose of fraud, but there have also been fraudulent \"discoveries\", e.g. in science, to gain prestige rather than immediate monetary gain.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fraud"}
