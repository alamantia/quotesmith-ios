The name hawthorn was originally applied to the species native to northern Europe, especially the Common Hawthorn C. monogyna, and the unmodified name is often so used in Britain and Ireland. However, the name is now also applied to the entire genus, and also to the related Asian genus Rhaphiolepis.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crataegus"}
