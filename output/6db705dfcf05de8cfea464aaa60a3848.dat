{"quote": "God Almighty first planted a garden", "page_title": "Gardens", "page_bio": "Garden are planned spaces, usually outdoors, set aside for the display, cultivation, and enjoyment of plants and other forms of nature. The garden can incorporate both natural and man-made materials. The most common form today is known as a residential garden, but the term garden has traditionally been a more general one. Zoos, which display wild animals in simulated natural habitats, were formerly called zoological gardens. Western gardens are almost universally based on plants, with garden often signifying a shortened form of botanical garden.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden"}
