Wallace (pen name of Dr. Wallace Ward) (1932 \u2013 26 January 2006) was an American author, publisher, and mail-order magnate. A research chemist for DuPont, Wallace changed his career in the late 1960s, focusing on publishing. His earliest works (circa 1968 - 1983) focus on tips and strategy for winning at poker, while later works shifted towards motivational business and philosophy, primarily published though his own firm, Integrated Management Associates. As a philosopher, he is best known as the originator of Neo-Tech, which he claimed to be an offshoot of Objectivism (Ayn Rand).", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank R. Wallace"}
