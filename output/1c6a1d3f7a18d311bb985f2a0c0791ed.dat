{"quote": "Beggars must be no choosers", "page_title": "Begging", "page_bio": "Begging (or, in old-fashioned terms, beggary) is to entreat earnestly, implore, or supplicate. It often occurs for the purpose of securing a material benefit, generally for a gift, donation or charitable donation. When done in the context of a public place, it is known as \"panhandling\", perhaps because the hand and arm are extended like the handle of a cooking implement, and not infrequently, a kitchen implement such as a pot or cup may be used.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Begging"}
