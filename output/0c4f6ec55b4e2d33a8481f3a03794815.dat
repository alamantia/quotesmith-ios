{"quote": "The pen became a clarion", "page_title": "Pens", "page_bio": "Pen are devices used to apply ink to a surface, usually paper, for writing or drawing. Historically, reed pens, quill pens, and dip pens were used, with a nib of some sort to be dipped in the ink. Ruling pens allow precise adjustment of line width, and still find a few specialized uses, but technical pens such as the Rapidograph are more commonly used. Modern types also include ballpoint, rollerball, fountain, and felt or ceramic tip pens.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pen"}
