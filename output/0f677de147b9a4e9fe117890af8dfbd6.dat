Most species are native to the temperate northern hemisphere. They comprise a genus of about 110 species in the lily family (Liliaceae). They are important as large showy flowering garden plants. Additionally, they are important culturally and in literature in much of the world. Some species are sometimes grown or harvested for the edible bulbs. The species in this genus are the true lilies. Many other plants exist with \"lily\" in the common English name, some of which are quite unrelated to the true lilies.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lilium"}
