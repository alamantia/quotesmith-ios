{"quote": "Nisi per legale judicium parum suorum", "page_title": "Law", "page_bio": "Law is a term referring to sociological or scientific norms, or systems and expressions based upon them. In social or political terms, the Rule of law refers to a system of rules or guidelines which are enforced through social institutions to govern the actions and behavior of individuals and groups of people within societies and between them, shaping politics, economics and general circumstances in numerous ways and providing further means of social mediation. The expressed civil laws of human societies often arise as postulates or proposals patterned upon or related to what are regarded as manifest laws of nature or divinity, and often make appeal to various notions of the proper social roles of justice, unity and liberty.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vedas"}
