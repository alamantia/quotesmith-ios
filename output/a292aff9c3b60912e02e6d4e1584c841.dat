{"quote": "Clarum et venerabile nomen", "page_title": "Names", "page_bio": "Name are labels for nouns such as people, things, places, products, and even ideas or concepts, and are normally used to distinguish one from another. Names can identify a class or category of things, or a single thing, either uniquely, or within a given context. A personal name identifies a specific unique and identifiable individual person. The name of a specific entity is sometimes called a proper name (although that term has a philosophical meaning also) and is a proper noun. Other nouns are sometimes, more loosely, called names; an older term for them, now obsolete, is \"general names\".", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hugin and Munin"}
