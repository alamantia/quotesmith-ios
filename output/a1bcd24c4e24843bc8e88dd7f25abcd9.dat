{"quote": "Cubism was born", "page_title": "Jean Metzinger", "page_bio": "Jean Metzinger (24 June 1883 \u2013 3 November 1956) was a French Category:Artists who lived and worked in Paris for most of his professional career. Inspired by the work of Georges Seurat and Paul C\u00e9zanne, he is one of the founders of Cubism, along with Pablo Picasso, Georges Braque and Albert Gleizes. Early on, Metzinger worked in the Divisionism and Fauvism styles with a strong C\u00e9zannian component, leading to some of the first Proto-Cubism works. From 1908 Metzinger experimented with the faceting of form, a style that would soon become known as Cubism. His early involvement in Cubism saw him both as an influential artist and principal theorist of the movement. The idea of moving around an object in order to see it from different view-points is treated in Metzingers Note sur la Peinture, published in 1910.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean Metzinger"}
