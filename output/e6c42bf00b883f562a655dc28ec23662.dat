{"quote": "That sweet enemy France", "page_title": "France", "page_bio": "France, officially the French Republic (French: R\u00e9publique fran\u00e7aise), is a unitary semi-presidential republic in Western Europe. Metropolitan France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. It is bordered (clockwise starting from the northeast) by Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, Switzerland, Italy and Monaco; with Spain and Andorra to the south. France is linked to the United Kingdom by the Channel Tunnel, which passes underneath the English Channel. Over the past 500 years, France has been a major power with strong cultural, economic, military and political influence in Europe and in the world. During the 17th and 18th centuries, France colonised great parts of North America and South Asia; and built the second largest empire of the 19th and early 20th centuries.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jules Michelet"}
