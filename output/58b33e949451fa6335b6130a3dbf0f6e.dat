{"quote": "O shame Where is thy blush", "page_title": "Shame", "page_bio": "Shame is regarded variously as an affect, emotion, cognition, state, or condition of embarrassment, dishonor, disgrace, inadequacy, humiliation, or chagrin. The roots of the word shame are thought to derive from an older word meaning to cover; as such, covering oneself, literally or figuratively, is a natural expression of shame.  \"To shame\" generally means to actively assign or communicate a state of shame to another. Behaviors designed to \"uncover\" or \"expose\" others are sometimes used for this purpose, as are utterances like \"Shame!\" or \"Shame on you!\" Finally, to \"have shame\" means to maintain a sense of restraint against offending others (as with modesty, humility, and deference) while to \"have no shame\" is to behave without such restraint (as with excessive pride or hubris).", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shame"}
