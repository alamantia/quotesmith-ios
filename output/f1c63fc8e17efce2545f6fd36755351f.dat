{"quote": "Ill print itbrAnd shame the fools", "page_title": "Printing", "page_bio": "Printing is a process for reproducing text and image, typically with ink on paper using a printing press. It is often carried out as a large-scale industrial process, and is an essential part of publishing and transaction printing. The development of printing was preceded by the use of cylinder seals in Mesopotamia developed in 3500 BC, and other related stamp seals. The earliest form of printing was woodblock printing, with existing examples from China dating to before 220 AD and Egypt to the 4th century. Later developments in printing include the movable type, first developed by Bi Sheng in China, and the printing press, a more efficient printing process developed by Johannes Gutenberg in the 15th century.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Printing"}
