Wilde later revised this edition, making several alterations, and adding new chapters; the amended version was published by Ward, Lock, and Company in April 1891.  The basic theme is of a man whose portrait ages while he remains young, leading him to debauchery.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Picture of Dorian Gray"}
