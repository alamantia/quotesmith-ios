{"quote": "He is a God", "page_title": "Achille Starace", "page_bio": "Achille Starace (August 18, 1889 \u2013 April 29, 1945) was a prominent leader of Fascist Italy prior to and during World War II. In 1931, his career reached its peak when he was made Secretary of the PNF. He was appointed to the position primarily due to his unquestioning, fanatical loyalty to Mussolini. As secretary, Starace staged massive parades and marches in favor of Mussolini and proposed Anti-Semitic racial segregation measures. On April 29, 1945, after a summary trial, he was sentenced to death. Starace was taken to the Piazzale Loreto and shown the body of Mussolini, which he saluted just before he was shot. His body was subsequently strung up next to Mussolinis.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Achille Starace"}
