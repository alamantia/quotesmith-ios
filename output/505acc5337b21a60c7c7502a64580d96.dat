{"quote": "Divisum sic breve fiet opus", "page_title": "Martial", "page_bio": "Martial was born sometime around 40 A.D. at Bilbilis, a small town in the north-east of Spain (Hispania). He is commonly known in the English speaking world as Martial. He was a scathing satirist, often writing highly derogatory poems of his acquaintances \u2014 including his patrons \u2014 which he published under the title of Epigrammata. Though not the first Roman poet to write in an epigrammatic style he is widely considered to have brought the epigram to its acme as a literary genre; thus he is rightly considered the Father of the Epigram.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martial"}
