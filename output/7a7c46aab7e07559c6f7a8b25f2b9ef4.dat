He had a thing for saying \"Thank you\" after some of his one-liners, depending on crowd reaction. He also acted very self-conscious and would randomly badmouth himself, especially if the crowd was left dumbstruck by a joke and didnt laugh much. It was all part of the act.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay London"}
