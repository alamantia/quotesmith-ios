{"quote": "Too cool for words", "page_title": "Pootie Tang", "page_bio": "Pootie Tang is a 2001 cult comedy film, directed by Louis C.K. The film was adapted from a comedy sketch which first appeared on The Chris Rock Show. The character Pootie Tang is a satire of the stereotyped characters who appeared in old blaxploitation films. His speech is mostly unintelligible to the audience, but the other characters in the film have no problem understanding him.  Pootie Tang was and is, too cool for words.  Its written in the spirit of \"Im Gonna Git You Sucka\", and is suggested in some circles needs citation puts the final nail in the coffin of the \"Blaxploitation\" genre.  The film is narrated by Pooties friend Trucky (not exactly trustworthy, but Pooties \"main Damie\" see below).", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lance Crouther"}
