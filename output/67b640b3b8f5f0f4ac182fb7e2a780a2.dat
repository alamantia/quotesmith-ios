{"quote": "Got a little gunhappy though", "page_title": "Mirror's Edge", "page_bio": "Mirrors Edge is a single-player first person action-adventure video game developed by EA Digital Illusions CE (DICE) and published by Electronic Arts. The game has a brightly coloured style and differs from most other first-person perspective video games in allowing for a wider range of actions\u2014such as sliding under barriers, tumbling, wall-running, and shimmying across ledges\u2014and greater freedom of movement, in having no heads-up display, and in allowing the legs, arms, and torso of the character to be visible on-screen. Mirrors Edge is set in a futuristic dystopian society, and so a network of runners, including the main character, Faith, are used to transmit messages while evading government surveillance. In the style of a three-dimensional platform game, the player guides Faith over rooftops, across walls, and through ventilation shafts, negotiating obstacles using movements inspired by parkour and free running.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror's Edge"}
