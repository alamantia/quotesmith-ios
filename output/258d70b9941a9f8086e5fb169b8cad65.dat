{"quote": "Palam mutire plebeio piaculum est", "page_title": "Sin", "page_bio": "Sin, in religious traditions, is an act that violates a known moral rule. The term may also refer to the state of having committed such a violation, and is often simply used to signify an action that is prohibited or considered wrong by some person or group of people; in some religious or social traditions, sin can refer not only to physical actions taken, but also to thoughts and internalized motivations and feelings. Colloquially, any thought, word, or act considered immoral, shameful, harmful, or alienating might be termed \"sinful\".", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin"}
