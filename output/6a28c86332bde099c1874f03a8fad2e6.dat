{"quote": "Injuriarum remedium est oblivio", "page_title": "Oblivion", "page_bio": "Oblivion (eternal) is an eternal state of lack of awareness thought by some to occur after death. This idea contradicts beliefs that there is an afterlife, such as a heaven or hell, after death. The idea of eternal oblivion stems from the idea that the brain creates the mind; therefore, when the brain dies, the mind ceases to exist. The name of the idea derives from the original meaning of the word, referring to a state of forgetfulness or distraction, or a state of being completely forgotten.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oblivion (eternal)"}
