It stars Johnny Depp, Charlize Theron, and Victoria Abril amongst others. NASA astronaut Spencer Armacost (Depp) is on a routine orbital mission when he and his colleague lose contact with Earth for two minutes. After they return home from their mission, Armacosts wife Jillian (Theron) sees odd changes in him, and becomes concerned about her new pregnancy. Are these related to the problem in orbit, or are they merely her old depressive tendencies resurfacing?", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Astronaut's Wife"}
