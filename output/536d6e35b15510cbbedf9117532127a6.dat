{"quote": "Be thou faithful unto death", "page_title": "Faith", "page_bio": "Faith is confidence or trust in a person, deity, the doctrines or teachings of a religion, or any specifable belief that is not based on proof. While some have argued that many forms of faith are opposed to reason, proponents of faiths argue that the proper domain of faith concerns questions which cannot be settled by evidence, and that rationality and faith are complimentary aspects of human Perception|perceptual and Imagination|imaginative capacities. The word faith is often used synonymously for hope, trust, belief, or a religious tradition.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Faith"}
