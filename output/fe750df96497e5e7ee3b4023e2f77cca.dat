{"quote": "For grief is crowned with consolation", "page_title": "Grief", "page_bio": "Grief is a multi-faceted response to loss, particularly to the loss of someone or something to which a bond was formed. Although conventionally focused on the emotional response to loss, it also has physical, cognitive, behavioral, social, and philosophical dimensions. While the terms are often used interchangeably, bereavement often refers to the state of loss, and grief to the emotional reaction to loss.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grief"}
