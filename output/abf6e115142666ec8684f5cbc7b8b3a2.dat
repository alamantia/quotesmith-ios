{"quote": "Stop quoting laws we carry weapons", "page_title": "Weapon", "page_bio": "Weapon, arm, or armament are terms for any device used to inflict damage or harm to living beings, structures, or systems. Weapons are used to increase the efficacy and efficiency of activities such as hunting, crime, law enforcement, self-defense, and warfare. In a broader context, weapons may be construed to include anything used to gain a strategic, material or mental advantage over an adversary. Ordinary objects such as sticks, stones, cars, or pencils can be used as weapons, but many are expressly designed for the purpose, such as clubs, swords, guns, intercontinental ballistic missiles, and cyberweapons.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon"}
