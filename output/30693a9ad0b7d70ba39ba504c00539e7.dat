Philosophy is distinguished from other ways of addressing such problems by its critical, generally systematic approach and its reliance on dialectic|rational argument. The word \"philosophy\" comes from the Ancient Greek (philosophia), which literally means \"love of wisdom\".", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodor W. Adorno"}
