{"quote": "SA boys received him coolly", "page_title": "Viktor Lutze", "page_bio": "Viktor Lutze (December 28, 1890 \u2013 May 2, 1943) was an SA officer who held the rank of Obergruppenf\u00fchrer in Nazi Germany. Lutzes participation in the Night of the Long Knives in 1934 was very important, as it was he who informed Adolf Hitler about Ernst R\u00f6hms anti-regime activities. When the time came, Lutze assisted Hitler in making lists of those who should be liquidated starting with seven top SA officials and ending with more than 80. After the purge Lutze succeeded R\u00f6hm as Stabschef SA. Lutze maintained his position in the SA until his death. On May 1, 1943 he was driving a car near Potsdam with his family. Driving too fast in a curve caused an accident that badly injured Lutze. Viktor Lutze died during an operation in a hospital in Potsdam at 10:30 the next evening. Hitler ordered a lavish state funeral for him on May 7, 1943 in the Reich Chancellery and attended in person, something he rarely did at that stage in the war. Lutze was posthumously awarded the Highest Grade of the German Order by Hitler. ", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viktor Lutze"}
