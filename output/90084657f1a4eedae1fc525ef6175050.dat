Modern editions use a later revised version printed in 1817 that featured a gloss. Along with other poems in Lyrical Ballads, it was a signal shift to modern poetry and the beginning of British Romantic literature. Quotes on this page are from the 1817 edition.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The Rime of the Ancient Mariner"}
