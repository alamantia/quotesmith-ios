The half-hour long show premiered on July 21, 1996, and was anchorman by Craig Kilborn until December 1998. Jon Stewart took over as host in January 1999, making the show more strongly focused on politics and the national media, in contrast with the pop culture focus during Kilborns tenure. It is currently the longest-running program on Comedy Central, and has won 18 Primetime Emmy Awards.    ", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael Mullen"}
