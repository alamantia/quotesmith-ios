{"quote": "Laudator temporis acti", "page_title": "Praise", "page_bio": "Praise is the act of making positive statements about a person, object or idea, either in public or privately. Praise is typically, but not exclusively, earned relative to achievement and accomplishment. Praise is often contrasted with criticism, where the latter is held to mean exclusively negative statements made about something, although this is not technically correct.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Praise"}
