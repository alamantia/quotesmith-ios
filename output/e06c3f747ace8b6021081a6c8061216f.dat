{"quote": "Puras deus non plenas adspicit manus", "page_title": "Hands", "page_bio": "Hand are prehensile, multi-fingered extremities located at the end of an arm or forelimb of primates such as humans, chimpanzees, monkeys, and lemurs. Hands are the chief organs for physically manipulating the environment, used for both gross motor skills (such as grasping a large object) and fine motor skills (such as picking up a small pebble). The fingertips contain some of the densest areas of nerve endings on the body, are the richest source of tactile feedback, and have the greatest positioning capability of the body; thus the sense of touch is intimately associated with hands.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John Farrar"}
