He runs a criminal syndicate called \"M.A.D.\", whose mascot is an evil cat named \"MAD Cat\" (which he keeps by his side). His hideout is usually in an old castle in Transylvania with a thunderstorm brewing outside. Dr. Claws plans would be foiled in every episode, forcing him to flee in his versatile black and red vehicle called the Clawmobile - also known as the MADmobile (which could fire missiles and change into a car, jet or submarine). While escaping he would yell his catch phrase: \"Ill get you next time, Gadget!... Next time!\" \u2014, or some variation, which was followed by MAD Cats signature yowl and hiss.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transylvania"}
