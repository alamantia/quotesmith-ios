{"quote": "Come like shadows so depart", "page_title": "Shadows", "page_bio": "Shadows are areas where direct light from a light source cannot reach due to obstruction by an object. A shadow occupies all of the space behind an opaque object with light in front of it. The cross section of a shadow is a two-dimensional silhouette, or reverse projection of the object blocking the light. The sun causes many objects to have shadows and at certain times of the day, when the sun is at certain heights, the length of shadows change.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadows"}
