The game takes place in the year 2186, with the player reprising the role of an elite human soldier named Commander Shepard, who is in the middle of a galactic-scale invasion of Reapers - sentient starships that wipe out all technologically advanced organic life in the galaxy every 50.000 years - and is tasked with putting together a coalition to face them. Shepard is customizable, and can be played as either a male or a female character.  Gender references in dialogue referring to Shepard will change (\"he,\" \"him,\" \"she,\" \"her\") depending on the players customization.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass Effect 3"}
