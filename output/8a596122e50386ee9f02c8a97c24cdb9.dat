The troubled events caused by the Allied invasion of Sicily and the ousting of Mussolini in Rome brought Nazi intervention and the proclamation of a new fascist puppet state, the northern Italian Social Republic. Pavolini was integrated to the Republics administration under Mussolini, and was immediately promoted head of the reformed PNF, the Republican Fascist Party. He was captured after a desperate escape attempt which saw him swimming across the Lake of Como and then trapped in a Mexican standoff over a half submerged rock. When he ran out of bullets, he was finally apprehended and executed by the partisans in Dongo.", "page_url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro Pavolini"}
